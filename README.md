This ShinyApp was written as an interactive exercise for undergraduate psychology students to learn about transformations to Z-scores and relevant areas under the normal curve. This app allows students to input different values for the means and standard deviations of the normal distribution, and an original test score to visualise the desired Z-score and equivalent area under the normal curve. This exercise also includes a little quiz component to test their understanding.
